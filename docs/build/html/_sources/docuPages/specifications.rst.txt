Analysis and conception
=========================

Analysis
--------
Actors
~~~~~~~~
    - standard user. For example : land use planning consultant, employee of a local authority, agriculture's minister, agricultural historian, common citizen
    - programmer


Use cases
~~~~~~~~~~
    
The standard user should be able :  
- to select an area of several parcels. The area can be selected at an european level. (example : select all the agricultural lands from Italia and Slovenia).
- to make specific request about the growing type of an area (example : where in Catalonia tomatoes are cultivated ?). 
- to generate statistics on an area (example : what is the proportion of barley growing in Wallonia ?)
- to visualize the evolution of agricultural parcels in a specific period of time (example : in Occitania, where agricultural lands have disappeared ?)

Recap
------
In the use cases drawing, the user can select a type, group, crop, sub-crop, sub-sub-crop. But this standards classification is not so obvious. 
Let's go to an example to understand what I am talking about.
