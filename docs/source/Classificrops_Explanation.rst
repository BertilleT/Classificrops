Description
------------
To match 2 classes, the tool uses a function that compute similarity between 2 words based on the letters they contains. It is not semantic based. 
Thus, this tool is limited when it comes to match strings that need semantic interpretation. 
As a consequence, this tool is not able to automate fully the conversion from a classification to the ICC one, but at least to semi-automate it. 
To sum up, Classificrops must be viewed as a helping tool to pre-work the conversion and save the user time by making the easy and basic matching.
