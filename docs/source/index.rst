Toolbox to  facilitate the re-use of Land Parcel Identification System national and regional data 
==================================================================================================
Each year, millions of croplands data are saved in national and regional Land Parcel Identification Systems(LPIS) to benefit from the Common Agricole Policy. 
This toolbox developed in python (version 3.9.12) was built to facilitate the re-use of those data.
For now, 2 tools are available : Classificrops and Agrivolution. To know more about them, please read their documentation.

    1. :doc:`Classificrops`
        Classificrops helps to convert one LPIS classification toward the Indicative Crops Classification(ICC) made by the FAO, in a semi-automated way. 
    2. :doc:`Agrivolution`
        Agrivolution is a croplands statistics viewer that allow to view shared statistics in Occitania and Catalonia.
